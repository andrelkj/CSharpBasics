     * Inheritance - a process in which one object acquires the properties of another object
     * Inheritance makes the information more manageable and creates a hierarchical order. It is the relationship between super classes (Base/Parent) and subclasses (Derived/Child)
     *
     * Types:
     * 1. Single level inheritance - There is only one parent class and one child class that derives everything from its parent
     * 2. Hierarchical inheritance - There is a parent class and multiple child classes that derives properties from their parent
     * 3. Multilevel inheritance
     * 4. Multiple inheritance (possible only through Interfaces)
     *
     * Note: only classes in lower levels can inherit the higher level classes' properties
     * 
     * Polymorphism - Overloading, Overriding
     * Abstract classes, Interfaces
     * Encapsulation - Data hiding, Abstraction
     * Getter and Setters
     * Constructors, this keyword
